# Chess-AI-using-Alpha-Beta-pruning
This project is a web application that uses alpha-beta pruning as main algorithm to play chess

This "Artifficial Intelligence" uses chess.js to control the state of the game, and uses an evaluating function based on what you can see in this tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977/
I have made a web application that uses this algorithm to play against an artifficial intelligence.
